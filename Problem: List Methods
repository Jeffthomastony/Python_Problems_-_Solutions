# Create a list number = [1, 2, 3, 4]. Write a program to:
  # Append the number 5 to the end of the list.
  # Insert the number 0 at the beginning of the list.

# Use append() to add an element to the last position of the list
number.append(5)

# Use insert() to add an element to a specific position/index in the list
